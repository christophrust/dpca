Description: Efficient implementations for estimating Generalized
  Dynamic Factor Models based on the work of Mario Forni and
  Marco Lippi (2001). This package currently
  covers (multivariate) spectral density estimation, truncated
  eigendecomposition, selection of the number of dynamic factors,
  projection on common component space.
