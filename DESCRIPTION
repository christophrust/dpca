Description: Efficient implementations for estimating Generalized Dynamic Factor Models starting with the works by Forni et al. (2000) and Forni and Lippi (2001). This package currently covers (multivariate) spectral density estimation, truncated eigendecomposition, selection of the number of dynamic factors, projection on common component space.
