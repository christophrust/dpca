This package provides a fast and reliable implementation of Brillinger's dynamic principal component analysis. The main use case is estimation of Generalized Dynamic Factor Models ([Forni & Lippi, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0266466601176048), [Forni, Hallin, Lippi and Reichlin, 2000](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2646650)).

At its core, this package features multivariate spectral density estimation based on the lag-window estimator. Based on an estimated spectrum, dynamic principal components are computed using an efficient numerical procedure for eigenvalue/eigenvector decomposition (Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi Method).

Moreover, `dpca` implements the method to select the number of dynamic principal components of [Hallin & Liska (2007)](https://doi.org/10.1198/016214506000001275). Also the information criteria by [Bai & Ng, 2003](https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0262.00273) are implemented, with the additional feature that the constant multplier in the penalty term is chosen in a data-driven way analogously to [Hallin & Liska (2007)](https://doi.org/10.1198/016214506000001275).

We are aware of the R package [`freqdom`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=freqdom), developed by Siegfried HÃ¶rmann and Lukas Kidzinsiki which is a pure `R` implementation. `dpca` is written mainly in `C`. Although providing a similiar interface to that of `freqdom`, `dpca` has some unique features apart from being much faster.

For instance, the convoluted filter which computes the dynamic common component from the output in `freqdom` is obtained by filtering the output twice: first to get the inputs \(what in `freqdom` is called "scores" in analogy to their FDA context\) and, second these inputs are filtered again to get the dynamic common component \("KLexpansion"\). `dpca` computes the convolution in the frequency domain. The advantage of this approach is that this filter is invariant with respect to multiplications of dynamic eigenvectors by a unit-length complex number.

## Installation

`dpca` depends on [`ARPACK`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPACK) to compute dynamic eigenvalues/eigenvectors using the Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi Method which is much faster than R's `base::eigen()` whenever a truncated instead of the full spectral decomposition is required. `ARPACK` is shipped with `dpca`.

To install `dpca` using `devtools`:

```r
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/christophrust/dpca.git")
```


## Example

```r
data(fredmd)
fredmd <- scale(fredmd)

freqs <- -50:50/50 * pi
res <- dpca::dpca(fredmd, freqs = freqs, qsel = TRUE, q = 10)

## eigenvalues
matplot(x = freqs, y = t(res$eig$values), type = "l")

## q selection
cat(sprintf("Number of selected dynamic components: %s\n", res$HL_select$q))

## sample variability of the criterion S^2_C (Hallin & Liska 2007, equation 10)
plot(x = res$HL_select$penalty_scales, y = res$HL_select$sample_var, type = "l",
     col = "red")
par(new = TRUE)
plot(x = res$HL_select$penalty_scales, y = res$HL_select$q_path,
     type = "l", axes = FALSE, bty = "n", xlab = "", ylab = "",
     col = "blue")
axis(4)
mtext("q_path", side = 4)
```
